## Deep Neural Networks from Scratch in C

Here I try to learn DNNs by re-implementing examples in C.

Currently working on:

- MNIST Handwritten Classifier

Implemented so far:

Layers:

- Linear Layer

Activation Functions:

- Sigmoid
- ReLU
- LeakyReLU

Processes:

- Feed Forward and Backpropagation
- MNIST load & access functions
